# HOW TO INSTALL (Nixos)

Before doing anything modify the flake with your username instead of mana !

To test this rice on NIXOS use:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake github:mana-byte/dotfiles-minecraft-style.nixos#minecraft --impure --no-write-lock-file
```

It will create a new user called mana with the rice.

To install on your current user use: (Remember to backup you config files first !)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mana-byte/dotfiles-minecraft-style.nixos.git

# change mana with your username in flake.nix and the other files below
# Add the packages you want in flake.nix

cd dotfiles-minecraft-style.nixos
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#minecraft --impure --no-write-lock-file
```

You also need to change mana with your username in the following files:
Config.qml, Hunger.qml, McHalfButton.qml, McSlider.qml, McButton.qml, Surface.qml

NOTE: If the imgborders plugin doesn't work you can compile and install it using => https://github.com/mana-byte/imgborders
